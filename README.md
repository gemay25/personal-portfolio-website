# Personal Portfolio Website

## Description
This is one of my first full web projects. It's a simple and clean personal portfolio where I share a bit about myself, highlight my skills, and include a contact form. I created it to practice semantic HTML structure, CSS layout, and form design while using Git for version control.

## Technologies Used
- HTML5 (Semantic structure, forms, and layout)
- CSS3 (Custom styling, layout, responsive design)
- Git (Version control and branching)

## How to View the Project
1. Download the folder named `exam_Genesis` or clone this repository.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your browser (double-click or right-click > open with...).
3. Explore the site:
   - A navigation bar to move between sections
   - An "About Me" section with two personal paragraphs
   - A "Skills" section listing 6 technical skills
   - A "Contact" section with a functional form
   - A footer with copyright
