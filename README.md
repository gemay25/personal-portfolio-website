# Personal Portfolio Website

## Description
This is one of my first web projects. It's a personal portfolio where I share a bit about myself, some projects, and a simple contact form. I made it to practice what I'm learning with HTML and CSS.

## Technologies Used
- HTML5
- CSS3
- Git (basic version control)

## How to View the Project
1. Download the folder called `exam_Genesis` (or the folder I used).
2. Open the file named `index.html` by double-clicking it.
3. The website should open in your browser â€” you'll see a menu, an "About Me" section, some example projects, and a contact form.# personal-portfolio-website
